1.Models For payments were removed/delete since they made a repetition in borrower models particularly.
2.views for login both students and admin were changed to fit bootstrapv5 feature,css and java featuresand are effective now.
3.changes are still made since some features are not yet active...such addbooks,  delete and login parts  to have reasonable display of results.
4.Foreaxample the admin would login to all the accounts that is nolonger available.
5.A feature of report has made a difference  for the admin  since printing reports is easy.
Thanks.
